The demonstration in Fallujah, 60 kilometres (about 35 miles) west of Baghdad, was one of several that began after Friday prayers across the country, while Shiite clerics called on the government to heed their demands. Protesters had been moving to an area in east Fallujah but were blocked off by soldiers deployed from Baghdad, Fallujah police Captain Nasser Awad told AFP. They began throwing bottles of water at the troops, who then opened fire. Prime Minister al-Malaki called on security forces to avoid force and said protesters had the right to demonstrate, but he also warned them to resist the incitement of what he called the ''conspiracies'' of regional intelligence agencies, remnants of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the former government and groups with sectarian agendas.

Sources told Vanguard that the crisis started at Agwashi village in Ekye Development Area, when an Agatu farmer confronted a Fulani man whose cow had allegedly destroyed his farm crops. The argument which later degenerated into a clash left two Agatu farmers dead. Equally, a reprisal attack on the Fulani which had reportedly hired some 20 foreign mercenaries with sophisticated weapons compounded the crises as it spread to three other villages.  Vanguard gathered that another crisis involved security agents and youths along Doma road near Lafia town when the youths in Mararaba village blocked the road close to a military check point in an attempt to resist further escalation of attack on their community by Fulani herdsmen.

The operations of these groups against citizens are \well-coordinated\", the commissioner explained. He added that these \"undisciplined people\" are not based on any specific areas and are \"killing and burning at random\". Various reports of fighters using \"heavy weapons\". This is a major gold mining area; later reports indicate 70,000 displaced and 150 villages burned. See comments.

A team of local chiefs traveling around Pibor County in Jonglei had reported 328 deaths so far - all Murle members and some of them women and children, according to Jodi Jonglei Boyoris, a senior state representative. The number of Lou Nuer killed and wounded remained unknown. Boyoris said he expected the death toll to rise although the fighting had died down this month.

The deadly fighting broke out Monday night between members of the local Toubou tribe and gold prospectors from the Zaghawa community, who had come from further afield, according to residents who spoke on condition of anonymity.
